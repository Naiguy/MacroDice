# MacroDice (In Progress)

MacroDice is a freeware app thats intended to help folks play tabletop RPGS at the table with a flare of animation. 
It's designed to record and store "dice macros", instances of a number of dice with the addition or subtraction of a static number.
For example: 2d6+3 means you roll 2 six-sided dice and add 3.
